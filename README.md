## Abstract

Located at the land-sea interface, the highly dynamic sandy beach and surf zone ecosystem is one of the coastal resources most intensely used by humans (e.g., recreation, fishing, tourism). However, the factors structuring fish assemblages in the surf zone are relatively understudied. To investigate the influence of season on surf zone fish communities, we evaluated seasonal trends in the fish assemblage and associations with environmental conditions using baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) at four beaches in the Northeast Pacific (California, USA) from July 2020 to June 2021. Surf zone fish assemblages exhibited marked seasonality and site-to-site variability. Several species of surfperch and leopard sharks were more common in the winter and spring, while flatfishes were more abundant in the summer months. The environmental variables of depth, visibility, temperature, and breaker height significantly affected fish abundance and species composition, with breaker height being the most influential factor. Species more abundant in winter, including barred, calico, and walleye surfperch were associated with larger waves, while a greater diversity of species were observed in periods of lower wave action. Our results highlight the influence of seasonal variation in environmental conditions on fish communities in this dynamic coastal habitat. This study is one of the first to evaluate temporal variation in the composition of surf zone fish assemblages in central California, USA and the broader Northeast Pacific region.
